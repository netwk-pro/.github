## 🐞 Bug Reports

A bug is a clear, reproducible issue in the code. High-quality reports help us fix problems faster.

### ✅ A good bug report includes

- A **descriptive title**

- Expected vs actual behavior
- Links to a minimal reproducible case (if possible)

_Example_:

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD042 -->

<section id="before-you-begin">

## 🧭 Before You Begin

Before opening a pull request, please make sure your environment and commits follow the project’s conventions.

### 🧱 Prerequisites

- **Node.js:** v24.x (LTS)
- **npm:** v11.x  
  _(See package.json → `engines` field for exact supported versions.)_

Install dependencies with:

```bash
cp .env.template .env
npm ci
npx playwright install
```

### 🪶 Code Style & Linting

This project uses:

- **[Prettier](https://prettier.io)** for formatting
- **[ESLint](https://eslint.org)** for static analysis
- **[Vitest](https://vitest.dev)** for testing

Please refer to **[Editor Configuration](https://github.com/netwk-pro/netwk-pro.github.io/wiki/Editor-Configuration)** in the [Wiki](https://github.com/netwk-pro/netwk-pro.github.io/wiki) for the full toolchain.

To ensure consistency, please run:

```bash
npm run checkout
```

This will:

- Verify Node and npm versions
- Run all tests (client + server)
- Lint and format your code
- Run SvelteKit’s type and build checks

> ✅ Tip: Run this before committing to catch issues early.  
> If Prettier check fails, use `npm run format:fix` to correct formatting, then re-run `npm run checkout`.

### 🧩 Branch Naming Convention

Use clear, consistent names for feature branches:

| Type     | Example                        | Description                    |
| -------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| Feature  | `feature/auth0-integration`    | New feature or enhancement     |
| Fix      | `fix/login-redirect`           | Bug fix or regression          |
| Chore    | `chore/deps-update`            | Dependency or tooling updates  |
| Docs     | `docs/contributing-update`     | Documentation-only changes     |
| Refactor | `refactor/component-structure` | Code cleanup or reorganization |

### 📝 Commit Messages

Please use clear, descriptive commit messages.  
If you prefer a convention, **Conventional Commits** are supported:

```cpp
type(scope): short description

[optional body]
```

Examples:

```scss
fix(auth): handle expired access token
chore(deps): pin vitest to 3.2.4 for compatibility
docs(contributing): clarify build process for SvelteKit
```

## 📦 Dependency Management

This project uses [`npm-check-updates`](https://github.com/raineorshine/npm-check-updates) (NCU) to manage dependency upgrades safely and predictably.

### ⚙️ Configuration

All upgrade rules and exclusions are defined in the root `.ncurc.cjs` file.  
This configuration ensures we only upgrade compatible dependencies and avoid breakage in core tooling.

**Example rules:**

- Only upgrade **production** and **dev** dependencies.
- Reject potentially breaking tools (e.g., `vitest`, `@vitest/coverage-v8`, `prettier`).
- Maintain clean, grouped CLI output during upgrade runs.

### 🪄 Commands

| Command                 | Description                                                          |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run check:updates` | Lists available dependency updates without modifying `package.json`. |
| `npm run upgrade`       | Applies safe upgrades using `.ncurc.cjs` rules.                      |

These commands are wrappers around NCU, keeping the behavior consistent across environments.

### 🚫 Rejected Packages

Certain packages are **intentionally pinned** due to breaking changes between major versions or ongoing test compatibility work.  
Do **not manually upgrade** these unless the project maintainer specifically approves it.

Commonly pinned packages include:

- `vitest`
- `@vitest/coverage-v8`
- `prettier`

If you think one of these can be safely updated, open a discussion issue or mention it in your PR description before upgrading.

### 🧱 Why We Use This Approach

We separate **rules** (in `.ncurc.cjs`) from **presentation** (via npm scripts) to keep updates consistent:

- `.ncurc.cjs` defines _what_ can change
- `npm run upgrade` defines _how_ it’s displayed
- Contributors don’t need to remember CLI flags or project-specific exclusions

This ensures every update is:

- predictable
- consistent
- and easy to review

## 🔁 Pull Requests

Well-scoped, well-documented pull requests are the lifeblood of open-source.

### ⚠️ Ask First

Before starting large PRs (new features, major refactors, or dependency upgrades), please open an issue or discussion first to align on approach.

### 📋 Steps

1. **Fork and clone the repo:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/netwk-pro.github.io.git
   cd netwk-pro.github.io
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/netwk-pro/netwk-pro.github.io.git
   ```

2. **Stay up to date with upstream:**

   ```bash
   git checkout master
   git pull upstream master
   ```

3. **Create a topic branch:**

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/my-feature
   ```

4. **Install:**

   ```bash
   cp .env.template .env
   npm ci
   npx playwright install
   ```

5. **Make and commit your changes:**
   - Use clear, descriptive commit messages.
   - Group related changes together logically.

6. **Test locally:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   npm run checkout
   ```

7. **Do not commit build artifacts.**

   ⚠️ SvelteKit builds are environment-specific and should not be checked into source control.
   The CI/CD pipeline will automatically build, test, and deploy your changes.

   Please **do not commit**:
   - `.svelte-kit/`
   - `build/`
   - `node_modules/`

   To ensure your local environment matches CI:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   (This validates your build works, but does not need to be committed.)

8. **Push and open your PR:**

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/my-feature
   ```

9. **Open your PR on GitHub:**
   - Use a clear title and description.
   - Reference any related issues.
   - Include screenshots or logs if relevant.

✅ Tip: Keep your PRs small and focused — it’s easier to review and merge quickly.

## ✅ Coding & Style Notes

- Use the defined code style (Prettier, ESLint, Stylelint, markdownlint).
- Avoid unrelated changes in the same PR.
- Keep PRs focused and test-covered when appropriate.
