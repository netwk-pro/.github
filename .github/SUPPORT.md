## 🧭 How to Get Support or Report an Issue

We encourage users to use our [structured issue templates](https://github.com/netwk-pro/netwk-pro.github.io/issues/new/choose) when possible. These templates help us respond more efficiently by gathering key information up front.

However, we understand that not all problems fit neatly into predefined categories.

- If you're unsure which template to use, or your situation doesn't fit any of them, you can still [open a blank issue](https://github.com/netwk-pro/netwk-pro.github.io/issues/new).
- If you need help getting started, feel free to post in our [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/netwk-pro/netwk-pro.github.io/discussions) or [join our Discord community](https://discord.neteng.pro/).
- Please be as descriptive as possible — especially when reporting bugs — so we can assist you quickly.

We value every contribution and will do our best to help you regardless of how you report an issue.

Thanks for helping improve Network Pro!
